# PYSQL ( python + mysql )

Overview: 
* I have designed and implemented a Database Accessing Application Logic from scrach.
* It's a MINI Project which express how can we connect mysql database with python using python mysql connector module.
* Project idea is based on real world senario : BLOOD BANK DBMS.

Features:
* This application provide a non-tech user a friendly interface to access database without knowning any Query language or database fundamentals.
* Mysql query writting process has been automated with help of python code.
* Because application is developed on OOPs methodology, Code is easy to maintain and modify.

Futher Improvement Possibilities:
 As Query writting process has been automated, User is restricted to predefined set of commands.
 Requirements of additional features from User's side can be fulfilled by Developer in no time.
 As adding features is easy task because of Clean uderstandable Code & OOPs benefits.

System Requirements
* pyhton3 installed with mysql-connector module (scr: https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/ )
* mysql installed 
* Database_details,user_id & password modified in pysql.py file.
