###### python + mysql

Overview:
8 I have designed and implemented a Database Accessing Application Logic from Scratch.
* It's a MINI Project which expresses how we can connect a mysql database with python using the python mysql connector module.
* Project idea is based on a real-world scenario : BLOOD BANK DBMS.

Features:
* This application provides a non-tech user a friendly interface to access databases without knowing any Query language or database fundamentals.
* Mysql query writing process has been automated with the help of python code.
* Because the application is developed on OOPs methodology, the code is easy to maintain and modify.

Further Improvement Possibilities: 
As Query writing process has been automated, User is restricted to a predefined set of commands. 
Requirements for additional features from User's side can be fulfilled by Developer in no time. 
Adding features is an easy task because of Clean understandable Code & OOPs benefits.

System Requirements
* python 3 installed with mysql-connector module (scr: https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/ )
* mysql installed
* Database_details,user_id & password must be modified in pysql.py file.
